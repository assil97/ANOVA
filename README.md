# ANOVA Test

ANOVA is also known as Analysis of Variance where it can be used to check the variance if the dataset contains more than two features.

The dataset which I used to check ANOVA is about the Human Body Bone Dataset which includes such as Normal Bone Density,
Osteoporosis, Osteneopia

There are two ways we can implement ANOVA:-
  * Checking mannually by applying the formula
  
    1. We have two formulas to check variance
    
        * MSSB which is also known as Mean Squared between the Dataset.
      
        * MSSW which is also known as Mean Squared within the Dataset.
      
  * Importing packages from scipy
